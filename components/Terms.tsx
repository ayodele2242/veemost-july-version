    In the event that a vendor provides VeeMost Technologies Inc. with special

    promotions to products sold into the permitted territory or territories as
    designated by the vendor. Customer agrees to reimburse VeeMost Technologies

    VeeMost Technologies Inc. harmless from and against any losses, claims,
    damages, penalties, costs, and expenses incurred by Customer as a result of
    Customer's failure to comply with this provision. This liability arises if
    Customer fails to sell the Products into the authorized territory(ies) as
    specified by the Vendor.

    VeeMost Technologies Inc. Customer gives up all rights to set-off or pursue
    a similar remedy against VeeMost Technologies Inc., in whole or in part, for
    any amount that VeeMost Technologies Inc. or any of its subsidiaries may owe
    Customer, whether at law, in equity, under contract, or otherwise. Payments
    may be applied by VeeMost Technologies Inc. to any account owned by the
    customer. VeeMost Technologies Inc. may delay, suspend, or cancel any

    to be immediately due and payable. The customer consents to pay interest
    according to the terms stated on each invoice until it is collected, at the
    rate of 1.5% per month, or the maximum rate allowed by law, whichever is
    lower, on any payment that is past late. Any credits offered by VeeMost
    Technologies Inc. will automatically expire after 12 months, unless
    otherwise specified by applicable legislation. &nbsp;

    Customer hereby expressly acknowledges and agrees that these General

    of any conditions to the contrary from third parties.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p style={{ marginTop: "0pt", marginBottom: "8pt" }}>
    Customer shall not be released from any payment obligation(s) to VeeMost

    Deliveries of products to locations outside of the United States shall be
    delivered Ex Works (Incoterms 2020), and all hardware deliveries to
    locations within the United States, excluding its territories and
    possessions, will be made FOB origin VeeMost Technologies Inc.'s specified
    location. When VeeMost Technologies Inc. tenders the Hardware to the
    transportation provider, the Customer will become the owner of the Hardware
    and assume all risk of loss, damage, or delay. Without prior consent from
    VeeMost Technologies Inc., the customer may not reroute a shipment of
    products from the company to a new consignee or destination after
    transportation has started.
  </p>
  <p style={{ marginTop: "0pt", marginBottom: "8pt" }}>
    If VeeMost Technologies Inc. arranges transport on VeeMost Technologies
    Inc.’s account, transportation will be arranged, and charges will be added
    to Customer’s invoice in accordance with VeeMost Technologies Inc.’s
    transportation policy at the time of shipment unless waived by an authorized
    representative of VeeMost Technologies Inc. in writing. VeeMost Technologies
    Inc. is not responsible for spotting, switching, demurrage or other
    transportation charges unless agreed in writing. VeeMost Technologies Inc.
    is not liable for any delays in delivery or for partial or early deliveries.
  </p>
  <p style={{ marginTop: "0pt", marginBottom: "8pt" }}>
    In the event that the customer instructs VeeMost Technologies Inc. to ship
    "freight collect" or charge transportation fees to a third-party account
    number, the customer is still in charge of all associated shipping and
    accessory costs as well as any claims for cargo loss or damage sustained
    during transit made with the transportation provider. Any needs from the
    customer that are not covered by these General Terms are not the
    responsibility of VeeMost Technologies Inc. All shipments, including those
    that are partially damaged or "short," must be accepted by the customer or
    the consignee receiving the delivery. The customer or consignee must check
    the products and obtain a written recognition from the transportation
    provider for any shortages, loss, damage, or nonconformance. Within three
    days of receiving a delivery, the customer must notify VeeMost Technologies
    Inc. in writing of any shortages or non-conforming products. The products
    shall be deemed approved if the customer does not inform VeeMost
    Technologies Inc. of any shortages or non-conforming products within the
    allotted three days.
  </p>
  <p style={{ marginTop: "0pt", marginBottom: "8pt" }}>
    The onus of submitting claims to the relevant transportation provider for
    cargo loss, damage, or delay (hereafter referred to as "Cargo Claims") will
    be entirely on the customer. VeeMost Technologies Inc. will help the
    customer file cargo claims with the transportation provider upon written
    request; this assistance will only include providing the customer with the
    data and records required to determine the amount and condition of the
    products at origin.
  </p>
  <p style={{ marginTop: "0pt", marginBottom: "8pt" }}>
    Customer &nbsp;will file Cargo Claims in writing with the appropriate
    transportation provider within nine months of delivery of the shipment or,
    in the case of delay or non-delivery, within nine months of the date the
    shipment should have been delivered. Lawsuits for cargo loss, damage or
    delay must be filed no later than two years from the date a claim is denied,
    in whole or in part, by the transportation provider.

  <p style={{ marginTop: "0pt", marginBottom: "8pt" }}>
    Products may only be returned by the customer in accordance with these
    general terms. Other than that, products cannot be returned, and fees and
    costs are not refundable. Items that get damaged after delivery cannot be
    exchanged. Customer must follow the most recent returns processing policies
    of VeeMost Technologies Inc. in order to be qualified for credit for
    returned products. Before returning any products, the customer must first
    get a valid return merchandise authorization number (or "RMA") from VeeMost
    Technologies Inc. RMAs are not required by VeeMost Technologies Inc.
  </p>
  <p style={{ marginTop: "0pt", marginBottom: "8pt" }}>
    Customer &nbsp;is responsible for ensuring that the RMA is clearly visible
    on the address label of the Product packaging and for complying with all
    other VeeMost Technologies Inc. requirements provided to &nbsp;Customer
    &nbsp;when the RMA is issued. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by VeeMost
    Technologies Inc., all Product returns from &nbsp;Customer &nbsp;are FOB
    destination VeeMost Technologies Inc.’s designated facility, and title and
    risk of loss will transfer to VeeMost Technologies Inc. upon receipt and
    acceptance of returned Products at VeeMost Technologies Inc.’s facility.
    VeeMost Technologies Inc. may refuse delivery of any package without a
    valid, clearly visible RMA. Except for defective or damaged Products, all
    Products must be returned with the original packaging intact (including
    manufacturer’s shrink wrap) and otherwise in unused, resalable condition.
    Credit will be provided for Product returned in accordance with VeeMost
    Technologies Inc.’s return policies at the time the RMA is issued.

    If &nbsp;Customer &nbsp;returns any Products without VeeMost Technologies
    Inc.’s authorization or does not comply with VeeMost Technologies Inc.’s
    return requirements, those Products may be subject to return to the shipping
    location and, if refused, VeeMost Technologies Inc. may consider the
    Products abandoned and dispose of them, without crediting &nbsp;Customer’s
    &nbsp;account. VeeMost Technologies Inc. may charge a restocking fee for
    handling any Product that is not returned in accordance with these
    &nbsp;General &nbsp;Terms. VeeMost Technologies Inc.’s sole liability for
    any returned Products will be acceptance of their return and issuance of
    credits pursuant to VeeMost Technologies Inc.’s returns processing
    guidelines.
